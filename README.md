# Machine Learning for OpenCV - Supervised Learning [Video]
This is the code repository for [Machine Learning for OpenCV - Supervised Learning [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/machine-learning-opencv-supervised-learning-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789347357), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Are you trying to build your own OpenCV system and you are facing any problems? Want to understand the key features of Machine learning?

If yes, then this is the course youâ€™re looking for!

We will start by discussing all the problems involved in creating a OpenCV system. Then learn to fit data using tools of our choice. Also we will exploring various algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines, and learn how to combine them with other OpenCV functionality. Finally we will build a machine learning system that can make a medical diagnosis.

By the end of this course, you will be ready create your own ML system and will also be able to take on your own machine learning problems
